======================================================================================================================================================================================================
But even in UDP if that makes many packets to be lost then that will also unacceptable right?  
  UDP can become unacceptable if too many packets are lost.
  But here’s the key idea:
      UDP doesn’t guarantee delivery — the application decides what to do about loss.
  Let’s unpack this carefully.

If UDP loses too many packets, why is it still used?
    First truth
      UDP itself provides:
           No retransmission
           No ordering
           No reliability
      So if 40% packets vanish — UDP doesn’t care.
      
But modern applications DO care.
    They build their own intelligence on top of UDP.
    This is the most important concept.

Example: Video streaming / calls
    Imagine Zoom / YouTube / Netflix:
    If 1–2 packets drop → video slightly blurs.
    If many packets drop:
        App automatically:
            Lowers video quality
            Reduces resolution
            Adds buffering
            Changes bitrate
        They adapt, instead of retransmitting everything.
        Waiting would destroy real-time experience.

Example: Online games
      If one position update is lost:
        No problem — next frame replaces it.
      But if packet loss becomes high:
        Characters teleport
        Lag increases
        Eventually disconnected
      Game servers monitor packet loss and kick clients if unstable.

Important modern trick
      Many big platforms use UDP + custom reliability layer
      For example:
          Google uses QUIC
          Netflix
          Meta Platforms
      They use QUIC (runs over UDP) which adds:
          Packet recovery
          Congestion control
          Encryption
      So:
          UDP gives speed
          QUIC adds smart reliability
        Best of both worlds.

So your question:
    “If UDP loses many packets, isn’t that unacceptable?”
    Answer:
        YES.
    If packet loss becomes high:
        Video freezes
        Calls drop
        Games disconnect
    At that point:
        Application stops session
        Network switches route
        Or user reconnects
    UDP doesn’t hide failure — it exposes it fast.
    TCP hides failure by retrying.

    Core difference:
      TCP philosophy:
          “Deliver everything correctly, even if it takes time.”
      UDP philosophy:
          “Deliver whatever arrives right now.”

Real engineering rule
      Use:
        TCP when:
          Data must be perfect
          Banking
          APIs
          Files
        UDP when:
          Data must be fast
          Live audio/video
          Games
          Real-time systems

UDP accepts loss to preserve real-time behavior, while TCP accepts delay to preserve correctness.
====================================================================================================================================================================================================

So we need to do some extra engineering to make the video streamings looks like to be fully visible?

    Yes, video streaming only looks smooth because engineers add extra logic on top of UDP (or sometimes TCP). The network itself doesn’t magically guarantee quality.

Part 1 — Do engineers add “extra engineering” for smooth video?
    Yes — 100%. Without this, video calls and streams would be terrible.
    Core idea
      UDP just throws packets.
      So apps like Netflix, Google (YouTube), and Zoom Video Communications build smart systems on top.
      They implement:
          1. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
            If your internet slows:
              1080p → 720p → 480p automatically
            They don’t wait for lost packets.
            They reduce quality in real time.
            That’s why sometimes video suddenly becomes blurry.
            
          2. Buffering
            They keep a few seconds of video stored ahead.
            So small packet losses don’t immediately freeze playback.

          3. Forward Error Correction (FEC)
            They send extra recovery packets.
            If 1–2 packets are lost → reconstructed without retransmission.

          4. Custom reliability over UDP (QUIC)
              Modern systems use QUIC (built over UDP) which adds:
                  Selective packet recovery
                  Congestion control
                  Encryption
              So:
                  UDP gives speed
                  QUIC adds intelligence
              Best combination.

          UDP alone is dumb.
          Streaming quality comes from application-level engineering.


====================================================================================================================================================================================================

And also explain about the three way handshaking protocol.
      This is how TCP creates a reliable connection before sending data.

      Step 1 — Client → Server : SYN
        Your browser says:
          “Hi server, can we talk?”
        This packet is called SYN.

      Step 2 — Server → Client : SYN + ACK
        Server replies:
          “Yes — I’m ready. I heard you.”
        This is SYN-ACK.

      Step 3 — Client → Server : ACK
        Client confirms:
          “Great — let’s start.”
        This is ACK.

      Connection established.
          Only after this:
              Web pages load
              APIs run
              Files download

In simple human terms:
      Client: Are you there?
      Server: Yes, I am. Are YOU there?
      Client: Yes. Let's talk.
  That’s it.

Why TCP needs this?
    Because TCP must:
      Ensure both sides exist
      Synchronize packet numbers
      Prepare buffers
      Start reliability tracking
    UDP skips all this — that’s why it’s faster.

Deep engineering difference
    TCP:
        Handshake → then data
        (reliable but slow startup)
    UDP:
        Data immediately
        (fast but risky)

TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection, while UDP sends data without any connection setup.

Final mental model
      Video streaming:
          UDP (fast)
          + buffering
          + adaptive quality
          + FEC
          + QUIC
          = smooth experience

      Web / APIs:
          TCP
          + handshake
          + retransmission
          = perfect data
