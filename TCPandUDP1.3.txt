Question:
TCP and UDP are okay, but then what are those extra stuffs like HTTP,FTP and HTTPS where these guys comes into play?

    TCP/UDP move data.
    HTTP / HTTPS / FTP define what that data means.

Where TCP/UDP and HTTP/FTP/HTTPS actually sit
    Think of networking like this:
            Your App (Browser / Client)
            ↓
            HTTP / HTTPS / FTP   ← Application Layer
            ↓
            TCP or UDP           ← Transport Layer
            ↓
            IP                   ← Internet Layer
            ↓
            Physical Network (cables, wifi, fiber)

    TCP / UDP
        HOW data moves
    HTTP / HTTPS / FTP
        WHAT the data represents

Analogy (real life)
    Imagine sending a package:
    IP
      = Address on the box
    TCP / UDP
      = Delivery service (safe courier vs fast courier)
    HTTP / FTP
      = Type of package + rules inside
