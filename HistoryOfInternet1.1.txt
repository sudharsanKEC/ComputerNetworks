History Of Internet

1960s – The Idea Begins
  During the Cold War, researchers in the US wanted a communication system that wouldn’t fail if one part broke.
  This led to ARPANET (1969), the first computer network.

1970s–1980s – Networks Learn to Talk
  Different networks were connected using TCP/IP (the Internet’s basic rules).
  In 1983, ARPANET officially switched to TCP/IP — this date is often called the birth of the modern Internet.

1991 – World Wide Web is Born
  Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web at CERN(The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)).
  He introduced:
      Web pages
      URLs
      Browsers
  This made the Internet usable for normal people, not just scientists.

1990s–2000s – Public Explosion
  Email, websites, search engines, and online businesses appeared.
  Companies like Google, Amazon, and Yahoo grew rapidly.
  Home Internet became common.

2010s–Now – Internet Everywhere
  Smartphones, social media, cloud computing, AI, streaming.
  Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix changed daily life.
  Today, the Internet connects billions of people and devices globally.

The Internet started as a military research network and evolved into a global system that connects the entire world.

Can you define this like how the exact history happened? From the cold war tension and how initially it was built? And how it was developed gradually over the days?

Phase 1: Cold War Tension (1950s–1960s)
    The problem
        After World War II, the US and USSR entered the Cold War.
        The US military had a serious fear:
            What if a nuclear attack destroys our central communication system?
        At that time:
            Communication networks were centralized
            If the main center failed → everything failed
        So the US wanted a network that:
            Has no single central control
            Still works even if parts are destroyed

The solution idea: Distributed networking
      US research agency DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded scientists to design a decentralized computer network.
      Instead of sending data as one big block, they invented:
            Packet Switching(Data broken into small packets, each finding its own path.)
      This was revolutionary.

1969 – Birth of ARPANET
      DARPA built ARPANET.
      First 4 connected universities:
        UCLA
        Stanford
        UC Santa Barbara
        University of Utah
      The very first message was supposed to be LOGIN.
      System crashed after “LO” 😄
      That’s literally how the Internet began.

Phase 2: Making Networks Speak Together (1970s–1980s)
  Now ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) worked — but another problem appeared:
  Different networks couldn’t communicate.
  So two scientists:
      Vint Cerf
      Bob Kahn
  created TCP/IP — the universal language of networks.
  1983 — Big turning point
      ARPANET officially switched to TCP/IP.
      This moment is considered:
           The birth of the modern Internet
      Now:
          Universities joined
          Research labs joined
          International networks joined
      Email became popular among scientists.
      Still: only researchers used it.
      No public websites yet.

Phase 3: World Wide Web (1991)
  Internet existed…
  But it was text-based, technical, hard to use.
  Then one man changed everything:
  Tim Berners-Lee
      Working at CERN, he invented:
        HTML
        URLs
        Web browser
        Web server
      He called it:
        World Wide Web
      Important:
        He made it FREE for everyone.
      This allowed:
        Websites
        Clicking links
        Images
        Normal people to use Internet

Phase 4: Public Explosion (1990s–2000s)
  Now Internet moved from labs → homes.
  Companies appeared:
    Google
    Amazon
    Yahoo
  People started using:
    Email
    Search engines
    Online shopping
    Chat rooms
  Dial-up modems → broadband.
  Internet became commercial + global.

Phase 5: Modern Internet (2010s–Now)
    Now we have:
      Smartphones
      Cloud computing
      AI
      Streaming
      Social media
    Platforms like:
      Facebook
      YouTube
      Netflix
    Internet is no longer “technology”.
    It is human infrastructure.

Everything else came later.

Whats TCP/IP here?
And what was before TCP and IP?


First: What exactly is TCP/IP?
    TCP/IP is a pair of protocols that tell computers how to send data across networks.
    It was designed by:
        Vint Cerf
        Bob Kahn
    And became official on ARPANET in 1983.

    TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
    Responsible for:
        Breaking data into packets
        Making sure nothing is lost
        Re-sending missing packets
        Putting packets back in correct order
    Think: “Did everything arrive safely?”

    IP = Internet Protocol
    Responsible for:
        Giving each computer an address (IP address)
        Deciding where packets should go
        Routing packets across routers
    Think: “Where should this packet travel?”

In simple words:
      IP finds the destination.
      TCP guarantees safe delivery.
    Together = TCP/IP.
    This combo is why the Internet actually works reliably.

Now the important part:
    What was BEFORE TCP/IP?  
        Answer: NCP (Network Control Protocol)
        Early ARPANET (1970s) used NCP.

Problems with NCP
    NCP could:
         Communicate inside ARPANET
         But it could NOT:
             Connect different networks
             Scale globally
             Handle packet loss properly
             Support international expansion
          It assumed:
              “Everyone is on the same network.”
            That became a big limitation.

The Big Realization (late 1970s)
      Researchers wanted to connect:
          Military networks
          University networks
          Satellite networks
          Radio networks
      NCP completely failed here.
      So Cerf & Kahn created TCP/IP with a revolutionary idea:
          Any network → any technology → same protocol.
      This is called:
          Internetworking
      (That’s literally where the word Internet comes from.)

1983 — The Historic Switch
      ARPANET officially dropped NCP and adopted TCP/IP.
      This moment is considered:
          The birth of the modern Internet
      After that:
          Universities joined
          Countries joined
          Commercial networks joined
      Boom → global Internet.

Simple timeline
1969 – ARPANET created
        ↓
1970s – Uses NCP (limited)
        ↓
Problems appear (can't scale)
        ↓
TCP/IP invented
        ↓    
1983 – ARPANET switches to TCP/IP
        ↓
Internet becomes possible


“NCP worked only inside ARPANET.
TCP/IP enabled multiple independent networks to interconnect — creating the Internet.”

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) → Reliable, ordered, slow but safe
    UDP (User Datagram Protocol) → Fast, lightweight, but no guarantees
    TCP = Registered post (with tracking)
    UDP = Normal post (just throw and go)

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
      What TCP does:
          Establishes connection first (3-way handshake)
          Sends data in order
          Detects lost packets
          Retransmits missing data
          Guarantees delivery
      Result:
          Slower
          More overhead
          Extremely reliable
      Used when correctness matters:
          Websites (HTTP/HTTPS)
          Email
          File downloads
          APIs
          Banking systems
      Example:
          If you download a PDF — even 1 missing byte is unacceptable → TCP.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    What UDP does:
      No connection setup
      No delivery guarantee
      No reordering
      No retransmission
    Just:
      Send → forget.
    Result:
      Very fast
      Very low overhead
      Can lose data
    Used when speed matters more than perfection:
      Video streaming
      Online games
      Voice calls
      Live broadcasts
    Example:
      In a video call, losing 1 frame is okay — waiting for it is not → UDP.

| Feature        | TCP              | UDP                 |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Connection     | Yes              | No                  |
| Reliability    | Guaranteed       | Not guaranteed      |
| Order          | Maintained       | Not maintained      |
| Speed          | Slower           | Faster              |
| Retransmission | Yes              | No                  |
| Overhead       | High             | Low                 |
| Typical use    | Web, APIs, Files | Games, Video, Voice |

What is overhead?
    Networking overhead is the additional information, processing, or time required by protocols and systems to successfully deliver data over a network, beyond the actual payload.

Real-world analogy (easy to remember)
  TCP:
    Teacher sending exam papers and waiting for acknowledgment from every student.
  UDP:
    Announcer speaking on loudspeaker — whoever hears it, hears it.

TCP prioritizes reliability; UDP prioritizes speed.

Important practical mapping:
    REST APIs → TCP
    Database connections → TCP
    Video streaming → UDP
    Multiplayer games → UDP
